I finally sat down to try out blogging with Github and Jekyll.  I have
to say, I'm very happy with it so far.  I stripped down the Jekyll-Bootstrap
template to my liking and have ended up with a very simple blogging system
based on Git and Jekyll (which is pretty convenient for this type of thing).

I get to use my favorite editor (vim) and don't have to deal with a web
interface to post.

Best of all, the hosting is free and relatively still "branded" for my
username.

Can't believe I didn't do this sooner.  If you're considering blogging
and want something lightweight with minimal setup, this is it.
