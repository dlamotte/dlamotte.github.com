Dan LaMotte
-----------
I live in WaKeeney, Kansas with my wife and dog.  I started "programming"
calculators in High School to help me (and others) remember common formulas
for math.  Little did I know then, but programming was something I loved to
do.

I graduated from the University of Minnesota: Twin Cities in 2009 with a BS in
Computer Science.  I currently work for a Fortune 500 company.
